## Operating System


### System Calls

A system call is a request of a kernel service (resides in C kernel space) called in userspace. The Linux [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) provides a set of those functions and each architecture provides its own set.

A small example of a system call in x86 can be found [here](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/SysCall/linux-syscall-1.html).
